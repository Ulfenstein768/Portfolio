# Úlfur Þór | Web developer portfolio

[ Live site ](https://portfolio-ulfurthor.vercel.app/)

This is the last assignment I did for the Reyjavík Academy of Web development.

I decided to make a portfolio built with Next.js and Prismic for easy data changing and handling, when I want to add items into my portfolio.

## Tech Stack

For my portfolio I used a series of different technologies, here is a list of them.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - a javascript framework created by Vercel
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a CSS framework
- [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) - a CMS backend

> I decided to try something new and implement prismic as a CMS,
> which is something I have never done before. As per usual when trying
> Something new, there are always some complications, but I managed to
> make it work and I am happy with the result. I have used Tailwind before,
> but not withing Next.js, so the setup was a bit different, but the use
> was the same in praxis. For the framework, Next.js is always something
> that is fun and easy to use and as of right now my favorite framework
> to use.
